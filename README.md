# LUISBankingBot

This bot uses LUIS (Language understanding intelligence service). Check out this [Overview of the LUIS service]. Currently the Pre-built entities are also listed on the overview page. You might also need some [Cognitive Services Keys]. This app useses some prebuilt composite entities (like number and money) for ease of implementatoin, a composite entity is just a bunch o' entities mashed together.

[Publish your Bot Application to Microsoft Azure] and show it to the world.

You can also [test your bot in a webapp].

As of 8/4/2016 LUIS has the followin limits on call usage.
| Plan | Description | Price|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Free | 10,000 transactions per month | Free |
| Standard | 10 transactions per second | $0.75 per 1000 transactions |

For fun I added emoji to the bot dialog. All emoji can be found on the [Emojipedia].
